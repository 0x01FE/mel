# Notes to Self

## credentials.json file
it existed. I don't know what it was for or if it was used.
removed it on 3/25/2023

## TODO

 [ ] bot tts still has windows filepaths, although i don't think any of the vc stuff works
 [ ] w2x won't run on Linux. remove it from twitter command?
 [ ] re-add dicer?
 [ ] finish Leaderboard.py
    [ ] Make leaderboard server specific.
    [ ] Consider something besides json


## Style
3 empty lines between each command
pascal casing

## About data/assets
volumes make it so that when COPY . . is ran in the dockerfile, that is overwritten by the volume
